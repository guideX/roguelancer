Description=Water
Body=Dihydrogen monoxide (H2O) is odorless, tasteless, transparent, and absolutely essential to human life. Roughly 75% of the human body is composed of Water. Deprived of Water, most humans can only live three days. The process of dehydration is a painful one, as tissues shrivel and vessels shrink in a desperate bid by the dying body to preserve its remaining vital functions.

Description=Oxygen
Body=A typical human being consumes over 12,000 liters of Oxygen (O2) daily. Oxygen, usually mixed with a neutral gas such as nitrogen, is absorbed through the tissues of the lungs and then diffused into the bloodstream, where it is carried throughout the body. All humans require a constant supply of Oxygen or they will perish within minutes.
