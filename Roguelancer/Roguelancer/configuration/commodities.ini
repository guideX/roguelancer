Description=Alien Organisms
Body=A previously undiscovered bacterial life form unique to the Sirius Sector, these microorganisms are remarkably efficient at metabolizing certain elements into oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. When seeded in an immature planetary environment they can accelerate the terraforming process tenfold, or provide a rich, abundant source of food for other organisms in more mature planetary ecosystems. >>> HIGHLY PERISHABLE <<< NOTE: Due to the highly perishable feature of this commodity, it is best transporting it for short distances, and in large numbers. This ensures the amount of commodity that survives the trip remains high.

Description=Artifacts
Body=Artifacts (not to be confused with the still-active Dom'Kavash Artifact) are the remains of ancient alien civilizations that developed while life on Earth was just emerging from the seas. Most Artifacts are devoid of any alien power source, and are little more than inert chunks of engraved crystals, providing the wealthy upper class of Sirius with a new status symbol. However, it is rumored that artifacts provided the inspiration for Jump Gate and Trade Lane technology, as well as other breakthroughs in shipbuilding technology. During the events of the Single Player Plot, political leaders such as Liberty's President Jacobi have seen fit to declare artifacts illegal, and they are viewed as contraband in all major houses. Artifacts are primarily harvested by the Corsairs from systems in the Edge Worlds, who then sell them to the Junkers and Hogosha for distribution in the colonies. The Order has successfully engineered these artifacts to be used as weapons against the Nomad threat by harvesting Nomad power cells from abandoned alien structures. These cells are extremely rare, however, and for all practical purposes the remaining artifacts in Sirius are dead, although active rocks have been found on planets such as Pygar. Large amounts of Artifacts can be found in the numerous wrecks surrounding the first Unknown (or Nomad) Jumphole in the Omicron Gamma system. However, large numbers of both Corsair ships and Nomad ships are in that area. Be cautious when entering that area if you are not friendly with the Corsairs. << ILLEGAL IN LIBERTY >>
