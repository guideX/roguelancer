This is for people who want to modify the models of the Freelancer Ships in MilkShape 3d or just simply view them in MilkShape 3d without having to find Milkshape 3d 1.7.6 so you can use the CMP import plugin which I find doesnt work on versions above MS3D 1.6.7.


This folder has 37 of the original Freelancer models taken from their original format and inported then exported into .ms3d format whch can be viewed with MilkShape3D. Milkshape 3D is available for download at www.milkshape3d.com.

Thanks to the CMP Importer for Milkshape 3d by Kurt, it was used to open the .cmp files which were then saved in ms3d format.

This includes:
Anubis
Armored Transport
Banshee
Barracuda
Bloodhound
Cavalier
Clydesdale
Crusader

Dagger
Defender
Dragon

Dromedary
